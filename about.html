<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Lisa Gonzalez. I am a married mom of 5 kids and a nana to 4 grandbabies. I recently took a leap of faith and moved back to 
  my home town of Melba, Idaho. 
</p>

<p>I am an animal lover, lover of the color yellow and love connecting with other people. I currently run a Facebook group called
  Goddess Inspired and enjoy creating opportunities for women to gather together. I also run an annual womens retreat and facilitate
  somatic movement through free dance.
</p>

<p>I am a creatrix. In the past I have owned several businesses in cake decorating and somatic movement facilitation. I have spent a
  number of years creating my own websites. I thoroughly enjoy the creating process and the masterpiece at the end. It wasn't until 
  recent did I decide to take this course to learn in depth the process of coding and web design.

  Please enjoy the creations! Live Free and love yourself unapologetically!
