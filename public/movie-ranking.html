<h1>TOP LOVE STORY MOVIES ACCORDING TO LISA G</h1>
<H2>My top 3 Romance Movies.</H2>
<hr>
<h3>1. The Notebook</h3>
<p>By far, one of the top movies to draw the viewer in. No one can resist the story line of young love and the fight to be together. I love how the movie toggles between the young couple and the dementia riddening elderly couple. Epic true love.</p>
<h3>2. PS I Love You</h3>
<p>This movie is a beautiful reminder of how fragile life is and not to take for granted the time we have together. I admire the depiction of how heavy grief is. I shed tears everytime I watch it.</p>
<h3>3. Hope Floats</h3>
<p>I love movies where there is a chase to win anothers heart. This movie perfectly shows how just being there for someone in their time of need allows space for ones heart to open back up to love.</p>
